Waterflow integration entities, data models
With name as configured, the following entities are created

sensor.<name>_info - Overall information entity
State value:  <Not applicable>
Attributes: {
    mq: <float>,  # waterflow in m3
    mlq: <float>, # waterflow in m3
    mhq: <float>  # waterflow in m3
}

sensor.<name>_waterflow - hindcast and forecast data for waterlevels from current date
State value:  <Not applicable>
Attributes: {
    startindex: <int>, # index of firstdate in 365 day calendar discarding leap years. Representing start date of data series
    firstdate: "2025-06-13T00:00:00", 
    lastdate: "2025-07-22T00:00:00"
    data:[  # list of waterflow values in m3, starting at firstdate (=startindex in 356 day calendar)
        <float>,
        <float>,
        ...
    ]
}

sensor.<name>_precipitation - hindcast and forecast data for precipitation from current date
State value:  <Not applicable>
Attributes: {
    startindex: <int>, # index of firstdate in 365 day calendar discarding leap years. Representing start date of data series
    firstdate: "2025-06-13T00:00:00", 
    lastdate: "2025-07-22T00:00:00"
    data:[  # list of precipitation values in mm, starting at firstdate (=startindex in 356 day calendar)
        <float>,
        <float>,
        ...
    ]
}

sensor.<name>_waterflow_history - historical data in 365 day calendar format
State value:  <Not applicable>
Attributes: {
    history: { 
        "<1991>" : [<float>,<float>,...], # 365 entries, waterflow levels in m3 for 1991
        ...,                              # 1992-2021
        "<2022>" : [<float>,<float>,...], # 365 entries, waterflow levels in m3 for 2022
    },
    average: [<float>,<float>,...], # 365 entries, average waterflow level in m3 for 1991-2022
    min: [<float>,<float>,...], # 365 entries, min waterflow level in m3 for 1991-2022
    max: [<float>,<float>,...], # 365 entries, max waterflow level in m3 for 1991-2022
}
